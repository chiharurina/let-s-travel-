ðŸ”’ Git Workflow & Branch Rules

To keep our project organized and prevent merge conflicts, please follow this workflow:

ðŸ§­ Branch Workflow

Never commit directly to main.
The main branch is protected â€” all changes must go through a Pull Request (PR).

Create a new branch for your task using one of these formats:

feature/your-feature-name â†’ for new features

fix/bug-description â†’ for bug fixes

chore/update-readme â†’ for documentation or small tweaks

Example:

git checkout -b feature/login-page


Make clear, descriptive commits.
Example commit messages:

feat: add login form validation
fix: correct typo in navbar
chore: update README with setup instructions


Open a Pull Request (PR) once your branch is ready.

Tag relevant reviewers if needed.

Wait for approval and make sure all conversations are resolved.

Once approved, merge it into main.


ðŸ’¡ Why We Do This

This workflow helps us:

Avoid merge conflicts

Keep a clean commit history

Ensure code review before changes go live

Protect our main branch from accidental changes
